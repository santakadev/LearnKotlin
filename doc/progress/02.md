# Session 2 - HelloWorld in the Command Line

**Duration**: 15m

## What have I done?

- HelloWorld in the Command Line

## What have I learnt?

- Compile Kotlin manually:
  - with the Kotlin runtime.
  - as a library.
- Use the Kotlin REPL.
- Kotlin Standar Library documentation

## What doubts have I?

- What is exactly the `KotlinJavaRuntime`?
- What is exactly a `jar`?
- How can I use Kotlin code compiled as library?
- It seams Kotlin generates a `main class name` for
each file `Hello.kt` -> `HelloKt`. Not sure how it works
and why this is needed for.

## What have I skipped to learn?

- What is a `jar` file.

## What should I do next?

- Learn something about JVM and `jar` files.
- Test Kotlin code.
- Using custom and third party libraries.
- Dependency management.
