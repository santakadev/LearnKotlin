# Session 1 - HelloWorld in IntelliJ

Duration: 1h

## What I done?

- Hello world in IntelliJ

## What have I learn?

- The `main` function is the entry point.
- The `main` function returns `kotlin.Unit` implicitly.
- `Unit` == `void`.
- IntelliJ compiles Kotlin.
- Returning an invalid type is a compile time error :D
- After running HelloWorld in IntelliJ, an `out` folder is generated.
- Inside the `out` folder there is something similar to a class/function map.
- Kotlin comes with a [testing library](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/kotlin.test/). 

## What doubts have I?

- How IntelliJ compiles kotlin.
- I don't know why the `out` folder is needed.
- I don't know if the `out` folder is something related to Kotlin or IntelliJ.
- I don't know why the `*.iml` file is needed.
- I don't if the `*.iml` file is something related to Kotlin or IntelliJ.

## What have I skip to learn?

- How to test Kotlin code.
- How to compile Kotlin manually.
- How Java/JVM works.
- How to manage dependencies.
- Kotlin for other platforms/topics (data science, mobile, etc.)

## What I think should I do next?

- Hello world outside IntelliJ
- Compile Kotlin manually
