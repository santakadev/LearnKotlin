# Session 3 - My first Gradle build

My intention was to make a test using kotlin-test, but then
realized that I need to install some dependencies, so I
started exploring how to use Gradle.

**Duration:** 30m

## What have I done?

- Getting started with Gradle

## What have I learnt?

- Template string concatenation.
- All functions return `Unit` implicitly (not only `main` as I expect).
- Kotlin test is an additional module. The dependency has to be added.
- Installing and using [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/)
- Installing and using [gradle](https://gradle.org/) build tool (basics).

## What doubts have I?

- Advantages/disadvantages of gradle compared to other tools like
Maven.
- Is there any community standard of using Gradle?
- Is there any IntelliJ integration of Gradle?

## What have I skipped to learn?

- Doing my first Kotlin test.
- Managing dependencies with Gradle.

## What should I do next?

- Install dependencies with Gradle.
- My first Kotlin test.
