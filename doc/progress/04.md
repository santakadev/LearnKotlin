# Session 4 - My first Kotlin test with JUnit

**Duration:** 1h

## What I want to do?

- My first Kotlin Test with JUnit using [this guide](https://guides.gradle.org/building-kotlin-jvm-libraries/).

## What have I done?

- My first Kotlin test with JUnit.
- Use Gradle to resolve dependencies: `Junit` and Kotlin `stdlib`.
- Gradle IntelliJ integration.
- Kotlin plugin IntelliJ integration.
- main/test project structure.

## What have I learnt?

- Basic `class` syntax.
- Basic `data class` syntax.
- Kotlin standard library `stdlib` is not included by default.
- `gradle test` is defined by default.
- Gradle download dependencies automatically.
- How to modify `soruces` in `*.iml` file to let IntelliJ
know where sources and test location.
- Basic Gradle IntelliJ integration.
- Basic Kotlin plugin IntelliJ integration.

## What doubts have I?

- Where are dependencies stored?
- Is the main/test package structure a requirement for
running tests with gradle?

## What have I skipped to learn?

- Working with `class`.
- Working with `data class`.
- Running tests modifying package structure.
- Use kotlin-test instead of JUnit.
- Use maven repository in Gradle instead of `jcenter`.

## What should I do next?

- Learn about `class` and `data class`.
- Use `kotlin-test` instead of `JUnit`.
- Learn more about working with packages.
